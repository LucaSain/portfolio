When writing his equations, Maxwell has intuited the existence of electromagnetic waves. However their existence was not yet proved experimentally. 

A bounty has been announced for proving the electromagnetic waves existence. Hertz conducted the experiments starting in 1886 in a _lecture hall_ (now called Heinrich Hertz lecture hall) and in 1888 Hertz proved the existence of radio waves:

> Hertz used a sphere gap in an oscillating electromagnetic dipole as emitter. The receiver was a slotted wire ring in which sparks were observed whenever a flashover took place at the emitter. On November 11, 1886, propagation of an electromagnetic wave was observed for the first time with this setup. Thus, James Clerk Maxwell’s close-range effect theory of electrodynamics was confirmed.

# The experiment

![Essay 1 - Hertz's experiments 2024-03-05 11.08.49.excalidraw.svg](/Essay%201%20-%20Hertz's%20experiments%202024-03-05%2011.08.49.excalidraw.svg)

In simple terms, the components of the experiments are:
+ A voltage generator
	+ An induction coil
+ An electromagnetic wave and sparks generator
	+ A capacitor (the Leyden jar)
+ The medium of propagation (air)
	+ $\epsilon_{air} \approx 1$
+ A detector
	+ A slotted wire ring, in which the sparks were observed

Because the sparks were very small, the experiment had to be conducted in a dark environment:

>For the sparks are microscopically short, scarcely a hundredth of a millimeter; they last only about a millionth of a second. It almost seems absurd and impossible that they should be visible; but in a perfectly dark room they _are_ visible to an eye which has been well rested in the dark. Upon this thin thread hangs the success of our undertaking. _said Hertz_

The sparks generated electromagnetic waves that were detected by the slotted wire ring. Thus the existence of the waves was confirmed. However, this was not enough. The properties of a wave had to be demonstrated as well: the **reflection, polarisation** and **refraction**:

For **reflection**, Hertz used a metal sheet that he placed on the trajectory of the wave.

For **polarisation**, waves pass through polarising filter to the receiver only when the wires are perpendicular to dipoles _(A)_, not when parallel _(B)_:

Finally, for refraction a prism made of pitch and it was observed that radio waves bend when passing through it, similarly to light waves when passing through a glass prism.

## The measurement of wavelength and frequency
Hertz fine-tuned his reflection experiment such that the wave would be standing. A **standing wave**, also known as a **stationary wave**, is a wave that oscillates in time but whose peak amplitude profile does not move in space:

</figure>

He observed that the wave was indeed standing by checking the distance at which the detector would emit a spark. Thus, the distance being constant, the wavelength $\lambda$ was determined and the period $T$ could be determined as well.
In Hertz's case, he had generated waves of 30 to 100 cm wavelength and 1000 - 300 MHz frequency.
And finally he calculated the speed of the wave:


$$v=\lambda f=c=3\times10^8m/s$$


Which proved to be the speed of light.

_note: The one way speed of light was never measured, only the two way speed of light was measured. It's impossible to measure the one way speed of light. This was documented in Einstein's paper on [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_speed_of_light)_

## Conclusion
Hertz's experiment proved not only the existence of electromagnetic waves, but also that their speed is indeed equal to the speed of light.
